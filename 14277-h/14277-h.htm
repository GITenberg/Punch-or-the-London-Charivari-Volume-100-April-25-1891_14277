    <p class="center">ACT I.</p>

    <blockquote>
        SCENE&mdash;<i>A Sitting-room cheerfully decorated in dark
        colours. Broad doorway, hung with black crape, in the wall
        at back, leading to a back Drawing-room, in which, above a
        sofa in black horsehair, hangs a posthumous portrait of the
        late</i> General GABLER. <i>On the piano is a handsome
        pall. Through the glass panes of the back Drawing-room
        window are seen a dead wall and a cemetery. Settees, sofas,
        chairs, &amp;c., handsomely upholstered in black bombazine,
        and studded with small round nails. Bouquets of immortelles
        and dead grasses are lying everywhere about.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Enter</i> Aunt JULIE (<i>a good-natured looking lady in a
    smart hat</i>).</p>

    <p><i>Aunt J.</i> Well, I declare, if I believe GEORGE or HEDDA
    are up yet! (<i>Enter</i> GEORGE TESMAN, <i>humming, stout,
    careless, spectacled.</i>) Ah, my dear boy, I have called
    before breakfast to inquire how you and HEDDA are after
    returning late last night from your long honeymoon. Oh, dear
    me, yes; am I not your old Aunt, and are not these attentions
    usual in Norway?</p>

    <p><i>George.</i> Good Lord, yes! My six months' honeymoon has
    been quite a little travelling scholarship, eh? I have been
    examining archives. Think of <i>that</i>! Look here, I'm going
    to write a book all about the domestic interests of the
    Cave-dwellers during the Deluge. I'm a clever young Norwegian
    man of letters, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Aunt J.</i> Fancy your knowing about that too! Now, dear
    me, thank Heaven!</p>

    <p><i>George.</i> Let me, as a dutiful Norwegian nephew, untie
    that smart, showy hat of yours. (<i>Unties it, and pats her
    under the chin.</i>) Well, to be sure, you have got yourself
    really up,&mdash;fancy that!
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He puts hat on chair close to
    table.</i></p>

    <p><i>Aunt J.</i> (<i>giggling</i>). It was for HEDDA'S
    sake&mdash;to go out walking with her in. (HEDDA <i>approaches
    from the back-room; she is pallid, with cold, open, steel-grey
    eyes; her hair is not very thick, but what there is of it is an
    agreeable medium brown.</i>) Ah, dear HEDDA!
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>She attempts to cuddle
    her.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>shrinking back</i>). Ugh, let me go, do!
    (<i>Looking at</i> Aunt JULIE'S <i>hat.</i>) TESMAN, you must
    really tell the housemaid not to leave her old hat about on the
    drawing-room chairs. Oh, is it <i>your</i> hat? Sorry I spoke,
    I'm sure!</p>

    <p><i>Aunt J.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Good gracious, little Mrs.
    HEDDA; my nice new hat that I bought to go out walking with
    <i>you</i> in!</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>patting her on the back</i>). Yes, HEDDA,
    she did, and the parasol too! Fancy, Aunt JULIE always
    positively thinks of everything, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>coldly</i>). You hold <i>your</i> tongue.
    Catch me going out walking with your aunt! One doesn't
    <i>do</i> such things.</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>beaming</i>). Isn't she a charming woman?
    Such fascinating manners! My goodness, eh? Fancy that!</p>

    <p><i>Aunt J.</i> Ah, dear GEORGE, you ought indeed to be
    happy&mdash;but (<i>brings out a flat package wrapped in
    newspaper</i>) look <i>here</i>, my dear boy!</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>opens it</i>). What? my dear old morning
    shoes! my slippers! (<i>Breaks down.</i>) This is positively
    too touching, HEDDA, eh? Do you remember how badly I wanted
    them all the honeymoon? Come and just have a look at
    them&mdash;you <i>may</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda.</i> Bother your old slippers and your old aunt
    too! (Aunt JULIE <i>goes out annoyed, followed by</i> GEORGE,
    <i>still thanking her warmly for the slippers</i>; HEDDA
    <i>yawns</i>; GEORGE <i>comes back and places his old slippers
    reverently on the table.</i>) Why, here comes Mrs.
    ELVSTED&mdash;<i>another</i> early caller! She had irritating
    hair, and went about making a sensation with it&mdash;an old
    flame of yours, I've heard.</p>

    <p><i>Enter Mrs.</i> ELVSTED; <i>she is pretty and gentle, with
    copious wavy white-gold hair and round prominent eyes, and the
    manner of a frightened rabbit.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>nervous</i>). Oh, please, I'm so
    perfectly in despair. EJLERT L&Ouml;VBORG, you know, who was
    our Tutor; he's written such a large new book. I inspired him.
    Oh, I know I don't look like it&mdash;but I did&mdash;he told
    me so. And, good gracious, now he's in this dangerous wicked
    town all alone, and he's a reformed character, and I'm
    <i>so</i> frightened about him; so, as the wife of a Sheriff
    twenty years older than me, I came up to look after Mr.
    L&Ouml;VBORG. Do ask him here&mdash;then I can meet him. You
    will? How perfectly lovely of you! My husband's <i>so</i> fond
    of him!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda.</i> GEORGE, go and write an invitation at once; do
    you hear? (GEORGE <i>looks around for his slippers, takes them
    up and goes out.</i>) Now we can talk, my little THEA. Do you
    remember how I used to pull your hair when we met on the
    stairs, and say I would scorch it off? Seeing people with
    copious hair always <i>does</i> irritate me.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. E.</i> Goodness, yes, you were always so playful and
    friendly, and I was so afraid of you. I am still. And please,
    I've run away from my husband. Everything around him was
    distasteful to me. And Mr. L&Ouml;VBORG and I were
    comrades&mdash;he was dissipated, and I got a sort of power
    over him, and he made a real person out of me&mdash;which I
    wasn't before, you know; but, oh, I do hope I'm real now. He
    talked to me and taught me to think&mdash;chiefly of him. So,
    when Mr. L&Ouml;VBORG came here, naturally I came too. There
    was nothing else to do! And fancy, there is another woman whose
    shadow still stands between him and me! She wanted to shoot him
    once, and so, of course, he can never forget her. I wish I knew
    her name&mdash;perhaps it was that red-haired opera-singer?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>with cold self-command</i>). Very
    likely&mdash;but nobody does that sort of thing here. Hush! Run
    away now. Here comes TESMAN with Judge BRACK. (Mrs. E. <i>goes
    out</i>; GEORGE <i>comes in with</i> Judge BRACK, <i>who is a
    short and elastic gentleman, with a round face, carefully
    brushed hair, and distinguished profile.</i>) How awfully funny
    you do look by daylight, Judge!</p>

        <p>"I am a gay Norwegian dog."</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Brack</i> (<i>holding his hat and dropping his
    eye-glass</i>). Sincerest thanks. Still the same graceful
    manners, dear little Mrs. HED&mdash;TESMAN! I came to invite
    dear TESMAN to a little bachelor-party to celebrate his return
    from his long honeymoon. It is customary in Scandinavian
    society. It will be a lively affair, for I am a gay Norwegian
    dog.</p>

    <p><i>George.</i> Asked out&mdash;without my wife! Think of
    that! Eh? Oh, dear me, yes, <i>I</i>'ll come!</p>

    <p><i>Brack.</i> By the way, L&Ouml;VBORG is here; he has
    written a wonderful book, which has made a quite extraordinary
    sensation. Bless me, yes!</p>

    <p><i>George.</i> L&Ouml;VBORG&mdash;fancy! Well, I
    <i>am</i>&mdash;glad. Such marvellous gifts! And I was so
    painfully certain he had gone to the bad. Fancy that, eh? But
    what will become of him <i>now</i>, poor fellow, eh? I
    <i>am</i> so anxious to know!</p>

    <p><i>Brack.</i> Well, he may possibly put up for the
    Professorship against you, and, though you <i>are</i> an
    uncommonly clever man of letters&mdash;for a
    Norwegian&mdash;it's not wholly improbable that he may cut you
    out!</p>

    <p><i>George.</i> But, look here, good Lord, Judge
    BRACK!&mdash;(<i>gesticulating</i>)&mdash;that would show an
    incredible want of consideration for me! I married on my chance
    of <i>getting</i> that Professorship. A man like L&Ouml;VBORG,
    too, who hasn't even been respectable, eh? One doesn't do such
    things as that!</p>

    <p><i>Brack.</i> Really? You forget we are all realistic and
    unconventional persons here, and do all kinds of odd things.
    But don't worry yourself!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He
    goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>to Hedda</i>). Oh, I say, HEDDA, what's to
    become of our Fairyland now, eh? We can't have a liveried
    servant, or give dinner-parties, or have a horse for riding.
    Fancy that!</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>slowly, and wearily</i>). No, we shall
    really have to set up as Fairies in reduced circumstances,
    now.</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>cheering up</i>). Still, we shall see Aunt
    JULIE every day, and <i>that</i> will be something, and I've
    got back my old slippers. We shan't be altogether without some
    amusements, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>crosses the floor</i>). Not while I have
    <i>one</i> thing to amuse myself with, at all events.</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>beaming with joy</i>). Oh, Heaven be
    praised and thanked for that! My goodness, so you have! And
    what may <i>that</i> be, HEDDA, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>at the doorway, with suppressed scorn</i>).
    Yes, GEORGE, you have the old slippers of the attentive Aunt,
    and I have the horse-pistols of the deceased General!</p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>in an agony</i>). The pistols! Oh, my
    goodness! <i>what</i> pistols?</p>

    <p><i>Hedda</i> (<i>with cold eyes</i>). General GABLER'S
    pistols&mdash;same which I shot&mdash;(<i>recollecting
    herself</i>)&mdash;no, that's THACKERAY, not IBSEN&mdash;a
    <i>very</i> different
    person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>She goes through the
    back Drawing-room.</i></p>

    <p><i>George</i> (<i>at doorway, shouting after her</i>).
    Dearest HEDDA, <i>not</i> those dangerous things, eh? Why, they
    have never once been known to shoot straight yet! Don't! Have a
    catapult. For <i>my</i> sake, have a
    catapult!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Curtain.</i></p>

    <p>"MORS ET VITA."&mdash;A fine performance, April 15, at
    Albert Hall, with ALBANI, HILDA WILSON, Messrs. LLOYD, and
    WATKIN MILLS, and Dr. MACKENZIE, as conductor or con-doctor. I
    should have given, writes our correspondent, a full and
    enthusiastic account of it, but that I was bothered all the
    time by two persons near me, who would talk and wouldn't
    listen. Thank goodness, they didn't stay throughout the
    performance. In a theatre they'd have been hushed down, but
    this is such a big place that a talking duet is heard only in
    the immediate neighbourhood of the talkers; and then no one
    wants to have a row during the performance of sacred music.
    It's like brawling in church.</p>

    <h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>THE TITHES QUESTION.&mdash;I am the Vicar of a country
    Church in Wales; but owing to the total failure of my last
    attempt to distrain on the stock of a neighbouring farmer, on
    which occasion I was tossed over a hedge by an infuriated cow,
    my family and myself are starving. I wish to know if I can
    legally pawn the lectern, the ancient carved pulpit, and
    several rare old sedilia in the Church? Or they would be
    exchanged for an immediate supply of their value in
    groceries.&mdash;URGENT.</p>

    <p>ANNOYANCE FROM NEIGHBOUR.&mdash;I live in a quiet street,
    and my next-door neighbour has suddenly converted his house
    into a Fried Fish Shop. Some of his boxes protrude into my
    front garden. Have I the right of seizing them, and eating
    contents, supposing them to be fit for human consumption? My
    house is perpetually filled with the aroma of questionable
    herrings, and very pronounced haddocks. I have asked, politely,
    for compensation, and received only bad language. What should
    be my next step?&mdash;PERPLEXED.</p>

    <p>DEED OF GIFT.&mdash;Upon my eldest son's marriage I wish to
    make him a really handsome money present. My idea is to hand
    over to him &pound;100, on condition that he repays me ten per
    cent, as long as I live, my age now being forty-five. Then as
    to security. Had I better get a Bill of Sale on the furniture,
    which he has just had given him by his wife's father for their
    new house, or how can I most effectually bind
    him?&mdash;GENEROUS PARENT.</p>

    <p>HOLIDAY TRIP.&mdash;Would one of your readers inform me of a
    locality where I can take my next summer's holiday of a month,
    for &pound;3 10<i>s.</i>, fare included? It must be near the
    sea and high mountains, with a genial though bracing climate.
    Good boating and bathing. Strictly honest lodging-house keepers
    and romantic surroundings indispensable.&mdash;EASY TO
    PLEASE.</p>

    <h3>MODERN TYPES.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</p>

    <h4>No. XXV.&mdash;THE ADULATED CLERGYMAN.</h4>

    <p>The Adulated Clergyman possesses many of the genuine
    qualities of the domestic cat, in addition to a large stock of
    the characteristics which tradition has erroneously assigned to
    that humble but misunderstood animal. Like a cat, he is
    generally sleek and has become an adept in the art of
    ingratiating himself with those who wear skirts and dispense
    comforts. Like a cat, too, he has an insinuating manner; he can
    purr quite admirably in luxurious surroundings, and, on the
    whole, he prefers to attain his objects by a circuitous method
    rather than by the bluff and uncompromising directness which is
    employed by dogs and ordinary honest folk of the canine sort.
    Moreover, he likes a home, but&mdash;here comes the
    difference&mdash;the homes of others seem to attract and retain
    him more strongly than his own. And if it were useful to set
    out the points of difference in greater detail, it might be
    said that the genuine as opposed to the traditional cat often
    shows true affection and quite a dignified resentment of snubs,
    is never unduly familiar, and makes no pretence of being better
    than other cats whose coats happen to be of a different colour.
    But it is better, perhaps, at once to consider the Adulated
    Clergyman in his own person, and not in his points of
    resemblance to or difference from other animals.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/196.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/196.png"
             alt="The Adulated Clergyman" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>He who afterwards becomes an Adulated Clergyman has probably
    been a mean and grubby schoolboy, with a wretched but
    irresistible inclination to sneak, and to defend himself for so
    doing on principle. It is of course wrong to break rules at
    school, authority must be respected, masters must be obeyed,
    but it is an honourable tradition amongst schoolboys that boys
    who offend&mdash;since offences must come&mdash;should owe
    their consequent punishment to the unassisted efforts of those
    who hold rule, rather than to the calculating interference of
    another boy, who, though he may have shared the offence, is
    unwilling to take his proportion of the result. A sneak,
    therefore, has in all ages been invested with a badge of
    infamy, which no amount of strictly scholastic success has ever
    availed to remove from him; and his fellows, recognising that
    he has saved his own skin at the expense of theirs, do their
    best to make up the difference to him in contempt and abuse.
    Schoolboys are not distinguished for a fastidious reticence. If
    they dislike, they never hesitate to say so, and they have a
    painfully downright way of giving reasons for their behaviour,
    which is apt to jar on a temperament so sensitive that its
    owner always and only treads the path of high principle when
    self-interest points him in the same direction.</p>

    <p>The school career of the future pastor was not, therefore, a
    very happy one, for at school there are no feeble women to be
    captivated by heartrending revelations of a noble nature at war
    with universal wickedness, and all but shattered by the
    assaults of an unfeeling world. Nor, strange to say, do
    schoolmasters, as a rule, value the boy who ranges himself on
    their side in the eternal war between boys and masters.
    However, he proceeded in due time to a University. There he let
    it be known that his ultimate destination was the Church, but
    he had his own method of qualifying for his profession. He was
    not afflicted with the possession of great muscular strength,
    or of a very robust health. Neither the river nor the
    football-field attracted him. Cricket was a bore, athletic
    sports were a burden; the rough manners of the ordinary
    Undergraduates made him shudder. However, since at College
    there are sets of all sorts and sizes, he soon managed to
    fashion for himself a little world of effete and mincing
    idlers, who adored themselves even more than they worshipped
    one another. They drank deep from the well of modern French
    literature, and chattered interminably of RICHEPIN, GUY DE
    MAUPASSANT, PAUL BOURGET, and the rest. They themselves were
    their own favourite native writers; but their morbid sonnets,
    their love-lorn elegies, their versified mixtures of passion
    and a quasi-religious mysticism, were too sacred for print,
    though they were sometimes adapted to thin and fluttering airs,
    and sung to sympathisers in private. Most of these gentlemen
    were "ploughed" in their examination, but the hero of this
    sketch secured his degree without honours, and departed to read
    for the Church.</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards he was ordained, was plunged ruthlessly into
    an East-End parish, and disappeared for a time from view. He
    emerged, after an interval of several years. The occasion was
    the inaugural meeting of a Guild for the Conversion of
    Music-hall <i>Artistes</i>, which is to this day spoken of
    amongst the irreverent as the Song and Sermon Society. The
    sensation of the meeting was caused by the fervent speech of a
    clergyman, who announced that he himself had been for some
    months a professional Variety Singer, attached to more than one
    Music-hall, and that, having studied the life <i>de
    pr&egrave;s</i>, he knew all its temptations, and was therefore
    qualified to speak from experience as to the best means of
    elevating those who pursued it. The details of his story, as
    they fell from the mouth of the reverend speaker, were highly
    spiced. His hearers were amused, interested, and stirred; and,
    when a daily newspaper gave a headlined account of the speech,
    with a portrait of the speaker, the professional fortune of the
    Adulated Clergyman (for it was he) was assured.</p>

    <p>Shortly afterwards his biography appeared in a series
    published in a weekly periodical under the title of
    <i>Unconventional Clerics</i>, and he himself wrote a touching
    letter on "The Plague Spots of Nova Zembla," in which an
    eloquent appeal was made for subscriptions on behalf of the
    inhabitants of that chill and neglected region. Ladies now
    began to say to one another: "Have you heard Mr. So-and-So
    preach? Really, not? Oh, you should. He's so wonderful, so
    convincing, so unlike all others. You must come with me next
    Sunday," and thus gradually he gathered round him in his remote
    church a band of faithful women, drawn from the West End by the
    fame of his unconventional eloquence. A not too fastidious
    critic might, perhaps, have been startled by a note of
    vulgarity in his references to sacred events, as well as by the
    tone of easy and intimate familiarity with which he spoke of
    those whose names are generally mentioned with bated breath,
    and printed with capital letters; but the most refined women
    seemed to find in all this an additional fascination. His
    sermons dealt in language which was at the same time plain and
    highly-coloured. He denounced his congregation roundly as the
    meanest of sinners. To the women he was particularly merciless.
    He tore to rags their little vesture of self-respect, shattered
    their nerves with emotional appeals, harrowed all their
    feelings, and belaboured them so violently with prophecies of
    wrath, that they left church, after shedding gallons of tears
    and emptying their expiatory purses into the
    subscription-plate, in a state of pale but pious pulp. In the
    drawing-rooms, however, to which he afterwards resorted, his
    manner changed. His voice became soft; he poured oil into the
    wounds he had inflicted. "How are you to-day?" he would say, in
    his caressing way. "Is the neuralgia any better? And the
    dulness of spirits? has meditation prevailed over it? Ah me! it
    is the lot of the good to suffer, and silence, perhaps, were
    best." Whereupon he is treated as a Father Confessor of
    domestic troubles, and persuades young married women that their
    husbands misunderstand them.</p>

    <p>It is unnecessary to add that his subscription-lists
    flourished, his bazaars prospered, his missions and retreats
    overflowed with feminine money, and his Church was overloaded
    with floral tributes. The brutal tribe of men, however, sneered
    at him, and perversely suspected his motives; nor were they
    reconciled to him when they saw him relieving the gloom of a
    generally (so it was understood) ascetic existence by dining at
    a smart restaurant with a galaxy of devoted women, whom he
    proposed to conduct in person to a theatre. Such, then, is, or
    was, the Adulated Clergyman. It is unnecessary to pursue his
    career further. Perhaps he quarrelled with his Bishop, and
    unfrocked himself; possibly he found himself in a Court of Law,
    where an unsympathetic jury recorded a painful verdict against
    him.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

    <p>My faithful "Co." says he has been reading the latest novel
    by "JOHN STRANGE WYNTER," called, <i>The Other Man's Wife</i>,
    as the French would observe, "without pleasure." As a rule he
    rather enjoys the works of the Author of <i>Bootle's Baby</i>,
    and other stories of a semi-ladylike semi-military character;
    but the newest tale is one too many for him. The "man" is a
    mixture of snob and cad,&mdash;say "a snad,"&mdash;the "other
    man" a combination of coward and bully, the "wife" a worthy
    mate to both of them. The plot shows traces of hasty
    construction, otherwise it is difficult to account for the
    "man's" intense astonishment at inheriting a title from his
    cousin, and the farfetched clearing up of a sensational
    West-End murder. My "Co." fancies that the peerage given to the
    "man," and the <i>vendetta</i> of the Polish Countess, both
    introduced rather late in Vol. II., must have been
    after-thoughts. However, the end of the story is both novel and
    entertaining. The feeble, fickle heroine is made to marry, as
    her second husband, the man who (as an accessory after the
    fact) has been the murderer of her first! And the best of the
    joke is&mdash;she does not know it! My "Co." has also been much
    amused by a brightly-written Novel, in one volume, called <i>A
    Bride from the Bush</i>. Mr. E. W. HORNUNG evidently knows his
    subject well, and has caught the exact tone, or rather nasal
    twang of our <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> Australian cousins. My
       "Co." says that "the Bride" is a particularly pleasant young
       person, thanks to her youth, good heart, and beauty.
       However, it is questionable&mdash;taking her as a
       sample&mdash;whether her "people" would "pan out" quite so
       satisfactorily. On the whole it would seem that Australians
       who have "made their pile" by buying and selling land are
       better at a distance&mdash;say as Aborigines!</p>

    <p>It is also the opinion of my faithful "Co." that the
    Clarendon Press series of <i>Rulers of India</i>, has never
    contained a better volume than the <i>Life of Mayo</i>, a work
    recently contributed by the Editor, Sir WILLIAM WILSON HUNTER.
    Admirably written, the book gives in the pleasantest form
    imaginable, a most eventful chapter in the History of
    Hindostan. But more, the pages have a pathetic personal
    interest, as the subject of the memoir was for many years
    misunderstood, and consequently, misrepresented. Even the
    <i>London Charivari</i> was unfair to the great Earl, but as
    Sir WILLIAM hastens to say, "at his death stood first in its
    generous acknowledgment of his real dessert, as it had led the
    dropping fire of raillery three years before." The author has,
    by publishing this most welcome addition to a capitally edited
    series, added yet another item to the long list of services he
    has rendered to our Empire in the distant East.</p>

    <p>Since Miss FLORENCE WARDEN'S <i>House on the Marsh</i>, says
    the Baron, I have not read a more exciting tale than the same
    authoress's <i>Pretty Miss Smith</i>. It should be swallowed
    right off at a sitting, for if your interest in it is allowed
    to cool during an interval, you may find it a little difficult
    to get up the steam to the high-pressure point necessary for
    the real enjoyment of a sensational story.</p>

    <h3>SILENT SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

    <p>DEAR MR. EDITOR,</p>

    <p>The great success that has attended the production of
    <i>L'Enfant Prodigue</i> at the Prince of Wales's Theatre has
    encouraged me to make a suggestion in the cause of English Art.
    Why not SHAKSPEARE in dumb show? The Bard himself introduced it
    in "The Play Scene." Allow me to suggest it thus:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        SCENE&mdash;<i>A more remote part of the Platform in
        Elsinore Castle. Enter</i> GHOST; <i>then</i> HAMLET.
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Hamlet</i> (<i>in dumb show</i>). "Where wilt thou lead
    me? Speak!" (<i>In dumb show.</i>) "I'll go no further."</p>

    <p><i>Ghost, by kissing his hand towards the horizon, shows
    that his hour is almost come, when he is bound to render
    himself to sulphurous and tormenting flames. The latter part of
    his description is composed of his shrinking about the stage,
    as if suffering from intense heat.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hamlet buries his face in his hands, and sobs pitifully,
    expressing</i> "Alas, poor Ghost!"</p>

    <p><i>Ghost repudiates compassion by turning up his nose, and
    throwing forward his hands; and then, by pointing from his
    mouth to his ear, demands</i> HAMLET'S <i>serious
    attention.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hamlet touches his own lips, points to</i> GHOST,
    <i>slaps his heart, and bows, intimating that the</i> GHOST
    <i>is to</i> "Speak!" <i>and he is</i> "bound to hear."</p>

    <p><i>Ghost explains that he is his father's spirit by
    stroking</i> HAMLET'S <i>face, and then his own, and then
    shrinks about the stage to weird music, descriptive of his
    prison-house. He concludes by appealing to</i> HAMLET'S <i>love
    for him by pressing his clasped hands to his own heart, and
    then pointing towards the left-hand side of his son.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hamlet jerks his hands passionately upwards, as if
    saying</i>, "Oh Heaven!"</p>

    <p><i>Ghost then asks for revenge by touching his dagger, and
    pointing towards the sky. He acts the murder in the garden,
    showing the serpent who stung him by gliding about the stage on
    his chest, like the boneless man. He shows his murderer to be
    of his own blood by walking up and down as himself, and then in
    the same way, but with a slight limp, as if he were his
    brother.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hamlet might here exhibit</i> "<i>Zadkiel's Almanack"
    as</i> "prophetic," <i>and slap the sole of his shoe for</i>
    "soul;" <i>for</i> "my Uncle" <i>it would be sufficient to
    produce a pawnbroker's ticket</i>:&mdash;"Oh my prophetic soul!
    Mine Uncle!"</p>

    <p><i>Then the Ghost in great detail acts the murder in the
    orchard, imitating the apples and the singing birds, the
    setting sun, &amp;c., &amp;c. He shows the composition of the
    poison after its plucking from a bush, and its arrival in the
    laboratory. He represents the actual pouring of the poison in
    his ear. He hints too (by suggesting the action of the
    bell-ringer) that he was never really mourned, and concludes a
    most spirited Ballet d'Action by a rapid sketch of the paling
    of the ineffectual fires of the glow-worm. As he leaves to the
    music of</i> "Then you'll Remember Me," HAMLET <i>imitates
    cockcrow, which brings the entertainment to an appropriate
    termination.</i></p>

    <p>Surely this would be an improvement upon the conventional
    reading? In this case where speech is silvern, silence would be
    golden.</p>

    <p>Trusting some Manager will take the matter up,</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Rom&eacute;o et Julietta.</i>
    JACK and NED DE RESZK&Eacute; <i>Rom&eacute;o</i> and <i>The
    Friar</i>. Why the waltz alone, which ought to be on every
    organ besides Miss EAMES'S, but which, strange to say, isn't
    thoroughly popular, should be enough to make an Opera; but it's
    like the proportion of one swallow in the composition of a
    summer, and, however well sung, it does not do everything. It's
    a dull Opera.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Carmen</i> again. House not
    immense. Persons "of note" chiefly on the stage. JULIA same as
    before; therefore refer to previous notice. Cab and carriage
    service after the theatres everywhere wants reforming
    altogether. We may not be worse off than in any other capital
    of Europe, but we ought to be far ahead of them.</p>

    <p>Somebody or other complained of my writing "GL&Uuml;CK"
    instead of "GLUCK," He didn't like the two dots; one too many
    for the poor chap, already in his dotage, so to relieve him and
    soothe him, I'll write it "GLUCK," and then he can go to the
    proprietor of "DAVIDSON'S Libretto Books" and ask him to take
    the dotlets off the "&Uuml;" in GL&Uuml;CK. I wonder if my
    strongly-spectacle'd fault-finder writes the name of HANDEL
    correctly? I dare say so correct a person never falls into any
    sort of error; or if he does, never admits it. I like it done
    down to dots, as "H&Auml;NDEL," myself; it looks so uncommonly
    learned.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<i>Tannh&auml;user.</i> Full and
    appreciative house to welcome the <i>rentr&eacute;e</i> of
    Madame ALBANI, who was simply perfection and the perfection of
    simplicity as the self-sacrificing heroine <i>Elizabeth</i>.
    From a certain Wagnerian-moral point of view, no better
    impersonator,&mdash;dramatically at least, if not
    operatically,&mdash;of the sensual Falstaffian Knight could be
    found than Signer PEROTTI; and, from every point of view, no
    finer representation of the Cyprian Venus than Mlle. SOFIA
    RAVOGLI. M. MAUREL was admirable in every way as the moral
    <i>Wolframo</i>, and Signor ABRAMOFF the gravest of Landgraves.
    The full title of this Opera should be <i>Tannh&auml;user; or,
    The Story of a Bard who sang a questionable kind of Song in the
    highest Society, and what came of it.</i></p>

    <p>Fine effect at end of First Act, when prancing steeds, with
    secondhand park-hack saddles, at quite half-a-crown an hour,
    are brought in, and, on a striking tableau of bold but
    impecunious warriors refusing to mount, the Curtain
    descends.</p>

    <p>Then what pleasure to see <i>Albani-Elizabeth</i> receiving
    the guests in Act II., varying the courtesies with an
    affectionate embrace whenever a particular friend among the
    ladies-of-the-court-chorus came in view. My LORD CHAMBERLAIN,
    viewing the scene from his private box, must have picked up
    many a hint for Court etiquette from studying this remarkable
    scene. Then how familiar to us all is the arrangement of the
    bards all in a row, like our old friends the Christy Minstrels,
    <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> being the Tambourine, and <i>Wolfram</i>
    the Bones! Charming. Great success. Repeat it by all means.</p>

    <h4>THE <i>IN</i>-KERRECT KERR.</h4>

    <p>IT was once said that Pianos may now be had on "MOORE and
    MOORE" easy terms every day. Mrs. WALTER found that those "easy
    terms" involved such pleasures as returning the instrument she
    had paid many instalments on, getting an order from the
    masterful Mr. Commissioner KERR to pay costs as well, and
    committal to prison for three weeks on the charge of "contempt
    of Court"&mdash;for disobeying an order which Justices SMITH
    and GRANTHAM declare the genial Commissioner had no sort of
    right to make!!!</p>

    <p>If this is the "hire-purchase system," a piano-less life is
    infinitely preferable to braving its manifold perils and
    penalties. Easy terms, indeed? Yes,&mdash;about as "easy" as
    "easy shaving" with a serrated oyster-knife! Mrs. WALTER'S fate
    should be a warning to would-be piano-purchasers, and, <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> would fain hope, to exacting System-workers and
    arbitrary Commissioners.</p>

    <p class="center">(<i>Fragment from a Romance founded upon
    evidence given before the Select Committee upon
    Dram-drinking.</i>)</p>

    <p>"I really think the experiment should be made," said the
    Professor. "Our knowledge on the subject is so imperfect, that
    nothing definite can be accurately pronounced."</p>

    <p>"True enough," replied one of his friends; "but although the
    end to be attained is excellent, may not the means be termed by
    the scrupulous 'questionable?'"</p>

    <p>"By the over-scrupulous, perhaps," returned the Professor,
    with a smile.</p>

    <p>"And the expense," observed a second of his intimates, "will
    be no small consideration. If we put the matter to a thorough
    test, a large quantity&mdash;a very large quantity of the
    necessary liquid will have to be purchased and disposed of. Am
    I not right in hazarding this supposition?"</p>

    <p>"Undoubtedly," responded the Professor, "and the cost will
    be enhanced by the fact that the necessary liquids will have to
    be of the best possible quality. As Dr. PAVEY observed before
    the Committee 'It is not the alcohol in itself that is
    injurious, but the by-products.' Our aim must be to eliminate
    the by-products."</p>

    <p>"I think the idea first-rate," said the third friend; and
    then he paused and added, seemingly as an after-thought, "Pass
    the bottle."</p>

    <p>So the Professor and his three companions decided to make
    the investigation in the cause of scientific research. It was
    resolved that after a week they should meet again, and that in
    the meanwhile they should in their own persons carry on the
    experiment continuously. When this had been arranged the
    friends parted company.</p>

    <p>At the appointed time the contemplated gathering became a
    concrete fact. The Professor's friends were the first to appear
    at the rendezvous. They were unsteady as to their gait, their
    neckties were in disorder and their hair falling carelessly
    over their eyes, added a fresh impediment to an eyesight that
    seemingly was temporarily defective. They sank into three
    chairs regarding one another with a smile that gradually
    resolved itself into a frown. Then they filled up the pause
    caused by the non-appearance of the Professor by weeping
    silently. Their emotion was not of long duration, as the
    originator of the experiment was soon in their midst. He seemed
    to be in excellent health and spirits.</p>

    <p>"My dear friend," he said, and it was noticeable that he was
    prone to clip his words, and to use the singular, in lieu of
    the plural, when the latter would have been more conventional,
    "My dear friend, glad see you all. Hope you well."</p>

    <p>His comrades received the well-meant greeting with a
    resentful frown, which ended in further weeping.</p>

    <p>"This very painful," continued the Professor, resting his
    hand somewhat heavily on the back of a chair; "very painful
    indeed! Fact is, you been taking wrong things!"</p>

    <p>His friends sorrowfully shook their heads negatively.</p>

    <p>"Yes you have! Sure of it! You, Sir&mdash;imbibed whiskey!
    No harm in good whiskey&mdash;excellent thing, good whiskey!
    But injuriverius&mdash;should say, injurious&mdash;if has too
    much flavour of malt! Your whiskey too much flavour of malt!
    You took brandy&mdash;bad brandy&mdash;too much taste of
    grapes! You took rum&mdash;bad rum&mdash;too much
    mo&mdash;mo&mdash;molasses! Now I took all three&mdash;whiskey,
    brandy, rum, but pure&mdash;no by-products. No, not at all.
    Result! See! Sober as judge!"</p>

    <p>And, succumbing to a sudden desire for slumber, the
    Professor, at this point of his discourse, joined his friends
    under the table!</p>

    <h4>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h4>

    <p><i>March 20. "George Hotel," Billsbury.</i>&mdash;Arrived
    here yesterday afternoon. Mother made up her mind to come with
    me, being very anxious, she said, to hear one of my splendid
    speeches. She brought luggage enough to last for a week, and
    insisted on taking her poodle <i>Carlo</i>, who was an awful
    nuisance, in the train. He growled horribly at old TOLLAND and
    BLISSOP when they came to see me at the Hotel before dinner.
    Very awkward. TOLLAND wanted to put before me the state of the
    case with regard to registration expenses. The upshot was that
    the Candidate is expected to subscribe &pound;80 a year to the
    Association for this purpose, which I eventually agreed to do.
    Found fourteen letters waiting for me. No. 1 was from Miss
    POSER, the Secretary of the Billsbury Women's Suffrage League,
    asking me to receive a small deputation on the question, and to
    lay my views before them. No. 2 from the Anti-Vaccination
    League, stating that a deputation had been appointed to meet
    me, in order to learn my views, and requesting me to fix a
    date. No. 3 and No. 4, from two local lodges of Oddfellows,
    each declaring it to be of the highest importance that I should
    become an Oddfellow and proposing dates for my initiation. Nos.
    5, 6 and 7 were from Secretaries of funds for the restoration
    or building of Churches and Chapels, appealing for
    subscriptions. Nos. 8, 9, and 10, from three more local Cricket
    Clubs, who have elected me an Honorary Member, and want
    subscriptions. No. 11 from a Children's Meat Tea Fund. No. 12
    asked me to subscribe to a Bazaar, and to attend its opening in
    June. No. 13, from the local Fire Brigade, and No. 14 from the
    Secretary of the Local Society for improving the Breed of
    Bullfinches, recommending this "national object" to my
    favourable notice. Shall have to keep a Secretary, likewise a
    book of accounts. Where is it all going to end?</p>

    <p>The Mass Meeting went off well enough. The Assembly Rooms
    were crammed. (The <i>Meteor</i> says, with its usual accuracy
    and <i>good taste</i>, "The attendance was small, the
    proceedings were dull. A wonderful amount of stale Jingoism was
    afterwards swept up by the caretakers from the floor. Our
    Conservative friends are so wasteful.") I was adopted as
    Candidate almost unanimously, only ten hands being held up
    against me. One or two questions were asked&mdash;one about
    local option, which rather stumped me&mdash;but I managed to
    express great sympathy with the Temperance party without, I
    hope, offending publicans.</p>

    <p><i>Carlo</i> somehow or other got out of the hotel and
    followed us to the meeting without being noticed. Poodles are
    all as cunning as Old Nick. He lay quite low in some corner or
    other, until Colonel CHORKLE was in the middle of a tremendous
    appeal to "the stainless banner which 'as so often been borne
    to triumph by Billsbury's embattled chivalry." The Colonel
    thumped on the table very hard, and <i>Carlo</i>, I suppose,
    had his eye on him and thought he was going to thump me. At any
    rate he sprang out and dashed at the Colonel, barking
    furiously. I had to seize him and take him outside. The Colonel
    turned quite pale. <i>The Meteor</i> says: "The war-like ardour
    which burns in the breast of Colonel CHORKLE was well-nigh
    extinguished by an intelligent dog, whose interruptions
    provoked immense applause." I had to apologise profusely to the
    Colonel afterwards. Mrs. CHORKLE looked daggers at me. Mother
    was delighted with the meeting. She has written about it to
    Aunt AMELIA.</p>

    <h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, April 13.</i>&mdash;So
    long since Lord STALBRIDGE parted company from RICHARD
    GROSVENOR that he forgets manners and customs of House of
    Commons. Not being satisfied with choice made by Committee of
    Selection of certain Members on Committee dealing with Railway
    Rates and Charges, STALBRIDGE writes peremptory letter to
    Chairman, giving him severe wigging; correspondence gets into
    newspapers; House of Commons, naturally enough, very angry. Not
    going to stand this sort of thing from a mere Peer, even though
    he be Chairman of North-Western Railway. Talk of making it case
    of privilege. Sort of thing expected to be taken up from Front
    Bench, or by WHITBREAD, or some other Member of standing.
    Somehow, whilst thing being thought over and talked about,
    SEXTON undertakes to see it through. As soon as questions over
    tonight, rises from below Gangway, and in his comically
    impressive manner, announces intention of putting certain
    questions to JOHN MOWBRAY, Chairman of Committee of Selection.
    Ordinary man would have put his questions and sat down. But
    this a great occasion for SEXTON. Domestic difficulties in
    Irish Party kept him away from Westminster for many weeks. No
    opportunity for Windbag to come into action; now is the time,
    as champion of privileges of House of Commons. Position one of
    some difficulty. Not intending to conclude with a Motion, he
    would be out of order in making a speech. Could only ask
    question. Question couldn't possibly extend over two minutes;
    two minutes, nothing: with the Windbag full, bursting after
    compulsory quiescence since Parliament opened.</p>

    <p>SEXTON managed admirably; kept one eye on SPEAKER, who from
    time to time moved uneasily in chair. Whenever he looked like
    going to interrupt, SEXTON lapsed into interrogatory, which put
    him in order; then went on again, patronising JOHN MOWBRAY,
    posing as champion of privileges of House, and so thoroughly
    enjoying himself, that only a particularly cantankerous person
    could have complained. Still, it was a little long. "This isn't
    SEXTON'S funeral, is it?" HARCOURT asked, in loud whisper.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:28%;">

    </div>

    <p>"No," said CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN; "it was meant to be
    STALBRIDGE'S; but I fancy SEXTON will save him from full
    inconvenience of the ceremony."</p>

    <p>So it turned out; House tired of business long before
    Windbag SEXTON had blown himself out. Poor JOHN MOWBRAY
    admittedly flabber-ghasted by the interminable string of
    questions under which SEXTON had tried to disguise his speech.
    STALBRIDGE got off without direct censure, and DONALD CAMERON
    abruptly turned the conversation in the direction of Opium.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Irish Land
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>House of Lords, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Lords met to-night
    after Easter Recess; come together with a feeling that since
    last they met a gap been made in their ranks that can never be
    filled. The gentle GRANVILLE'S seat is occupied by another.
    Never more will the Peers look upon his kindly face, or hear
    his lisping voice uttering bright thoughts in exquisite
    phrase.</p>

    <p>KIMBERLEY sits where he was wont to lounge. K. a good safe
    man; one of the rare kind whose reputation stands highest with
    the innermost circle of those who work and live with him. To
    the outside world, the man in the street, KIMBERLEY is an
    expression; some not quite sure whether he isn't a territory in
    South Africa. Known in the Lords, of course; listened to with
    respect, much as HALLAM'S <i>Constitutional History of
    England</i> is occasionally read. But when tonight he rises
    from GRANVILLE'S seat and makes a speech that, with
    readjustment of circumstance, GRANVILLE himself would have
    made, an assembly not emotional feels with keen pang how much
    it has lost.</p>

    <p>The MARKISS should be here. Perhaps for himself it is as
    well he's away. To him, more than anyone else in the House, the
    newly filled space on the Bench opposite is of direful import.
    _The MARKISS has no peer now GRANVILLE is gone; the two were in
    all characteristics and mental attitudes absolutely opposed,
    and yet, like oil and vinegar, the mixing perfected the salad
    of debate. The lumbering figure of the black-visaged Marquis at
    one side of the table talking at large to the House, but with
    his eye fixed on GRANVILLE; at the other, the dapper figure,
    with its indescribable air of old-fashioned gentlemanhood, the
    light of his smile shed impartially on the benches opposite,
    but his slight bow reserved for the MARKISS, as, leaning across
    the table, he pinked him under the fifth rib with glittering
    rapier&mdash;this is a sight that will never more gladden the
    eye in the House of Lords. GRANVILLE was the complement of the
    MARKISS; the MARKISS was to GRANVILLE an incentive to his
    bitter-sweetness. Never again will they meet to touch shield
    with lance across the table in the Lords. LYCIDAS is dead, not
    ere his prime, it is true;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"But, O the heavy change, now thou art gone,</p>

            <p>Now thou art gone, and never must return!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It seemed in stumbling inadequate phrase that CRANBROOK,
    KIMBERLEY, DERBY, and SELBORNE strummed their lament. But,
    speaking from different points of view, without pre-concert,
    they struck the same chord in recognising the ever unruffled
    gentleness of the nature of LYCIDAS&mdash;a gentleness not born
    of weakness, a sweetness of disposition that did not
    unwholesomely cloy. Only Mr. G. could have fitly spoken the
    eulogy of GRANVILLE. After him, the task belonged to the
    MARKISS, and it was a pity that circumstances prevented his
    undertaking it. <i>Business done</i>,&mdash;Irish Land Bill in
    Commons.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Brer FOX turned up today,
    unexpectedly. So did MAURICE HEALY, even more unexpectedly.
    Irish Sunday Closing Bill under discussion. Great bulk of Irish
    Members in favour of it. First note of discord introduced by
    Windbag SEXTON. Belfast Publicans, who find their business
    threatened, insist that he shall oppose the Bill; does so
    accordingly, separating himself from his party. Brer FOX
    quickly seized the opportunity; he, too, on he side of the
    Publicans, who hold the purse, and, money (like some of their
    customers) is tight. So PARNELL lavishly compliments Windbag
    SEXTON on his "large and patriotic view"; hisses out his scorn
    for the Liberal Party; declares that Ireland abhors the
    measure, which he calls a New Coercion Bill.</p>

    <div class="figright"

             mildest-mannered Man."
    </div>

    <p>Then, from bench below him, uprises a bent, slight figure,
    looking less like a man of war than most things. A low, quiet
    voice, sounds clearly through the House, and Mr. MAURICE HEALY
    is discovered denying Brer FOX'S right to speak on this or any
    other public question for the constituency of Cork.</p>

    <p>"If he has any doubt on this subject," the mild-looking
    young man continued, "let him keep the promise he made to me
    about contesting the seat."</p>

    <p>That was all; only two sentences; but the thundering cheers
    that rang through House told how they had gone home.</p>

    was a stranger, bound for the Gallery. But when GRANDOLPH
    turned, and glared on him, saw his mistake as in a flash of
    lightning.</p>

    <p>"Same eyes, anyhow," said Mr. JARRATT, getting back to the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
